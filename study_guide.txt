Slides:
	Software Qualities
		Malleable - easy to change, hard to change right
		Requirements / environment change over time
		Correctness  - Correct with respect to a formal specification
		Reliability  - Prob that a prog will not fail after a given tme
		Robbustness  - Behaves reasonably under stress
		Performance	 - Uses resources efficiently
		Portabliity	 - Transports to another platform easily
		Usibility	 - Ease of use
		Maintainence - Ease of maintaining
		Reusability	 - How easily can code / design be reused
		Usefulness	 - Usefulness
	Software LifeCycles
		Code & Fix	 - Doit(); - Code, debug
			+ Quick progress. Low overhead
			+ Protorypes, scripts
			- Not good for big things
			- No planning. No documentation.
		WaterFall	 - Communication(); Planning(); Modeling(); Constructions(); Deployment();
			+ Good for well understood, complex problems
			+ Orderly easy-to-follow model - inexperienced engineers
			- All planning upfront - harder if problem not well understood
			- Non adaptive to change in requirements
			- No code or integreation till very end
		Boehm's Spiral		- while(!done()){Communication; Planning; Modeling; Constructions; Deployment;}
		Unified Process 	- Inception(); Elaboration(); Construction(); Transition(); 
			Inception 		- outline use cases / key requirements
			Elaboration 	- finalize requirements, define software architechure
			Construction 	- develop initial running system
			Transition		- complete product release
		Agile Processes		- foreach(week : time){doWork(); evaluatePriorities();}
			Small tasks generated from cusstomer requirements
			Re-Evaluate priorities after each cycle - 1 day - 1 week
			+ Flexible, allows for adaptation to changing customer requirements
			+ Focus on small increments of work, minimizes risk
			- Higher cost at start of project than more traditional methodologies
			Extreme Programming - SCRUM but with a dumb name
				Continuous Unit/Regression testing
				Pair programming w/ on the fly design - start simple increace complexity as needed
				+ On-site customer as part of team
				- Little to no documentation, most thigs are white boarded then implemented
				- Not great for large projects
			Scrum 			- foreach(sprint : time){doWork(); sprintMeeting();}
				Scrum master tessl team what to do, team does it
				Deliverable produced at end of each sprint
	Software Requirements
		Scope	- all things system will do
		Functional Req 		- What the system should do
							- Inputs, Outputs, Computations, etc.. 
		Non-Functional Req 	- How the system does things, Constraints for development
							- Platform, Dev process, Response time, Throuput, Resource usage
		Req Features		- Verifiable, Consistent, Unambiguous, Completeness
			Verifiability 	- Must be testable (pass/fail) - unambiguous, no adverbs
			Passive Voice 	- The action is done by X 	- Wrong
			Active Voice	- X does the action			- Right
			Ambiguity		- Many - ambiguous - 100 - unambiguous
			Consistency 	- Requirements cannot contradict one another
	Use Case Analysis - UC
		Use Case 	- Sequence of actions that an actor performs to complete a task 
					- Describes a users interaction with a system
					- Does not describe computations of a system, Independent of GUI
					- Help with defining scope of a system, and planning for development
					- Name, Actors, Goals, Preconditions, Description, 
							Related UCs, steps, Post Conditions
		Actors		- Users or other systems that interact with the system
		Extension		- exception --> case
			- Describe optional interactions or rare cases		
		Generalization	- children --|>	 superclass
			- Represents several similar UCs, superclass
		Inclusion		- case --> common step
			- Common steps between several UCs
			- Dont have to repeat across many UCs
